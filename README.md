# ScientificMethodology

## Homework (Lesson 1)

[ x ] Read Popperâ€™s text   
[ x ] Indicate your name on the Pad. You will use to collaborate and fill in all the information you can.  
[ x ] Register on the Mattermost through this invitation link. This is the preferred communication mode.  
[ x ] Set up a public github or gitlab project for this lecture. You will take notes on this lecture and turn your homework and computational documents in this project.  
[ x ] Register to the MOOC on Reproducible Research  
[ x ] Follow modules 1 + 2 of the MOOC with as much exercises as possible (except the last one of module2, on Challenger; watching interviews is optional)  
[ x ] Set up a computational document system (e.g., Rstudio or Jupyter on your laptop or through the UGA JupyterHub).  
[ x ] Report the URL of your git project, your mattermost ID on the Pad.  

## Homework (lesson 2)

[ x ] Start learning R by reading this R crash course for computer scientists (Rmd sources) (slides 14-20)

[ (partial) ] Complete the two data analysis/visualization in a clean R notebook and upload in your github/gitlab space. Make sure we can easily find it when landing on your page. :)

[ (partial) ] MOOC: Complete exercise 5 of module 2 (Challenger). Write a short text explaining what is good and wrong about this document (you may want to provide an updated version of the notebook) and upload on your github/gitlab space.
