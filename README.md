# ScientificMethodology

## Homework (1)

[ x ] Read Popper’s text   
[ x ] Indicate your name on the Pad. You will use to collaborate and fill in all the information you can.  
[ x ] Register on the Mattermost through this invitation link. This is the preferred communication mode.  
[ x ] Set up a public github or gitlab project for this lecture. You will take notes on this lecture and turn your homework and computational documents in this project.  
[ x ] Register to the MOOC on Reproducible Research  
[ x ] Follow modules 1 + 2 of the MOOC with as much exercises as possible (except the last one of module2, on Challenger; watching interviews is optional)  
[ x ] Set up a computational document system (e.g., Rstudio or Jupyter on your laptop or through the UGA JupyterHub).  
[ x ] Report the URL of your git project, your mattermost ID on the Pad.  

## Homework (2)

[ x ] Start learning R by reading this R crash course for computer scientists (Rmd sources) (slides 14-20)

[ x ] Complete the two data analysis/visualization in a clean R notebook and upload in your github/gitlab space. Make sure we can easily find it when landing on your page. :)

[ x ] MOOC: Complete exercise 5 of module 2 (Challenger). Write a short text explaining what is good and wrong about this document (you may want to provide an updated version of the notebook) and upload on your github/gitlab space.

## Homework (3)

[ x ] See previous homeworks and provide links in the Pad!

[ x ] First name/last name analysis in a computational document.

## Homework (4)

[ x ] Use good naming and organization conventions in your repos.

[ ] See previous homeworks: use dplyr and ggplot for the first/last name analysis! Complete challenger if you haven’t done so.

[ - ] If you have time, git a try to git-annex but no worry if you can’t. What’s important is that you know it exists, what it allows to do, and that it is not so difficult to use.

[ x ] Engage in module 3 of the MOOC

[ ] Choose a topic for the peer evaluation (final task of module 3).

## Homework (5)

[ x ] Continue the hands-on, improve the experiment design and the analysis
