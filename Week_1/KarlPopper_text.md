The text approaches the division between science and pseudoscience.

Among the examples of non-scientific theories given by Popper, both theories that are evidently pseudoscientific (astrology) and more consolidated theories at the time (Marx's historical materialism and Adler's personality/inferiority theory) are tackled.

The common aspect between these theories deemed pseudoscientific by my bud Karl is the *lack of falsifiability*, i.e., there are no hypotheses or tests in which such theories could be proven wrong.

Overall quite a nice read, 10/10 I can see why Popper got famous.
